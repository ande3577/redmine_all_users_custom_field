# Redmine All Users Custom Field

## Overview

This plugin allows enabling a user-type custom field to show all users in its 
list (not just members of the project).

This feature can be enabled in two locations.  The custom field settings page
allows setting the field to all users for all projects where it is used.  The
project settings page adds an option to showe  all users for all custom fields 
on the project.
